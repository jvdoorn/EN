# EN (2019)
EN is a first-year Experimental Physcis course at Leiden university. This repository merges all the code I have written for the 6 separate parts of this course.

This code by is not 'clean' by any means. I decided to keep it however for any future reference and perhaps it may be of use for other students following the EN course.

Please not that not all experiments are reoccuring experiments (you had to design them yourself) - the code for these experiments will in that case not be reusable for future students following the course.
